## UX principles

- Minimal, calm, premium aesthetic (ample white space, subtle motion)
- Opinionated defaults; advanced options one tap away
- Accessible: contrast, reduced motion, keyboard nav, screen reader labels
- Gentle language for breaks and nudges

## Visual direction

- Typography: system sans; consider Inter for brand builds
- Color: neutral base, accent color for state (success/active)
- Components: cards, sheets, toggles with micro-interactions
- Motion: 150â€“220ms ease; avoid bouncy animations; respect reduced motion

## Interaction

- Keyboard shortcuts on desktop for start/stop and quick add task
- Drag-and-drop reorder for tasks
- Natural-language task input (future)
